## Heyo!

I'm in my fifth semester studying physics at Universit√§t Heidelberg. 

Currently I am working on a project internship in the GALENA Group at the ARI (Astronomisches Recheninstitut) here in Heidelberg.

As a result as well as apart from my studies I am always eager to expand my coding and technical knowledge, which this is supposed to be a platform for.


### I hope you are having a great day!
